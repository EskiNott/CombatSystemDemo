Pack includes 50+ slash prefabs.

NOTE:
For the sword slash to work properly, you need to use "HDR" on main camera and add CC.asset(post processing profile) that use bloom with help of Post Processing behaviour script.

Using effects:
Drag&drop prefab on the sword and change the sword slash with the help of curves and particle system.

Using shaders:
All shaders work only with particle system using "Custom vertex stream" in render tab. 
Use UV + Custom1.xy for Slash shader and UV + UV2 + Custom.xyzv for Fade slash shader.
Then use custom data x and y (z for in FadeSlash shader to control cutout). One for slash path, another for slash length.
